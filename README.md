### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Muhie Aldeen, originally from Syria. Recently, I completed a comprehensive full-stack developer course at HackYourFuture. My passion lies in continuous learning, problem-solving, and embracing new challenges.

Aside from my technical skills, I bring a unique perspective with a background in law, particularly in areas such as Data Protection and Privacy Rights, as well as Intellectual Property Rights. This blend of legal expertise and technical proficiency positions me to contribute effectively in dynamic environments.

I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills and look forward to exploring opportunities to make meaningful contributions.
